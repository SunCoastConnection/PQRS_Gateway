Measure #113 (NQF 0034): Colorectal Cancer Screening
National Quality Strategy Domain:  Effective Clinical Care


DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients 50 through 75 years of age who had appropriate
screening for colorectal cancer

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period
for patients seen during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis
associated with this measure. Performance for this measure is not limited
to the reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who
perform the quality actions described in the measure based on services
provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.

Measure Reporting via Registry:
CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are used to identify patients
who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator
options are used to report the numerator of the measure.



DENOMINATOR:
*	Patients 51 through 75 years of age with a visit during the measurement period
Definition:
The age ranges for the description (50 -- 75), and the denominator (51
-- 75) are different due to how the measure is calculated. The clinical
guidelines supporting the three different screening approaches that
state adults 50 years and older should be screened. The measure has a
denominator of 51 to capture all adults at least 50 years of age and
older who may have had a screening. For example, a patient who turns 51
in July of the measurement period was 50 when they had the appropriate
screening in February; therefore, those patients who are 50 are included
in the description.


Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases):
*	Patients 51 through 75 years of age on date of encounter
AND
*	Patient encounter during the reporting period (CPT or HCPCS):

NUMERATOR:
Patients who had at least one or more screenings for colorectal cancer
during or prior to the measurement period.
Appropriate screenings are defined by any one of the following criteria below:
>  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) during the measurement period
>  Flexible sigmoidoscopy during the measurement period or the four years prior to the measurement period
>  Colonoscopy during the measurement period or the nine years prior to the measurement period
