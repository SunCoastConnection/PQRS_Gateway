Measure #40 (NQF 0048): Osteoporosis: Management Following Fracture of Hip, Spine or Distal
Radius for Men and Women Aged 50 Years and Older – National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective
Clinical Care
2015 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES:
CLAIMS, REGISTRY
DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 50 years and older with fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius that had a central
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement ordered or performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed
INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported after each occurrence of a fracture during the reporting period. It is anticipated that
clinicians who treat hip, spine or distal radial fractures will submit this measure. Each occurrence of a fracture is
identified by either an ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for fracture or osteoporosis and a CPT service code OR
an ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a fracture or osteoporosis and a CPT procedure code for surgical
treatment of fractures.
Patients with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius should have a central DXA measurement ordered or
performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed. The management (DXA ordered or performed or pharmacologic
therapy prescribed) should occur within three months of the initial visit with the reporting clinician following the
fracture. If multiple fractures occurring on the same date of service are submitted on the same claim form, only one
instance of reporting will be counted. Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. Patients with
documentation of prior central DXA measurement or already receiving pharmacologic therapy would automatically
meet the intent of this measure.
Measure Reporting via Claims:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT or HCPCS codes, and patient demographics are used to identify
patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes and/or quality-data codes are used
to report the numerator of the measure.
When reporting the measure via claims, submit the listed ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT or HCPCS
codes, and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR quality-data code OR the CPT Category II code with the
modifier. The modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient reasons, 3P- system reasons,
8P- reason not otherwise specified. All measure-specific coding should be reported on the claim(s) representing the
eligible encounter.
Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are
included in the measure’s denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the
measure.
The quality-data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry-based submissions; however, these codes may
be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data.
DENOMINATOR:
All patients aged 50 years and older with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius
Eligible cases are determined, and must be reported, if either of the following conditions are met:
Option 1 - Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases):
Patients aged ≥ 50 years on date of encounter

one or more encounters during the reporting period, or documentation that patient is already taking
pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis, as documented in the current medical list.
