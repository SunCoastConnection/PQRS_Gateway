Measure #109: Osteoarthritis (OA): Function and Pain Assessment
Domain: Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outcomes

DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patient visits for patients aged 21 years and older with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) with assessment for function and pain

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported at each visit occurring during the
reporting period for patients with osteoarthritis seen during the
reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform
the quality actions described in the measure based on the services
provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.

Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, and patient demographics
are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's
denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator
of the measure.  The quality-data codes listed do not need to be submitted
for registry-based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted
for those registries that utilize claims data. There are no allowable
performance exclusions for this measure.



DENOMINATOR:
All patient visits for patients aged 21 years and older with a diagnosis of OA

Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases):
*	Patients aged >= 21 years on date of encounter
          AND
*	Diagnosis for osteoarthritis (OA) (ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM)

*	Patient encounter during the reporting period (CPT):

NUMERATOR:
//  Patient visits with assessment for level of function and pain documented (may include the use of a standardized scale or the completion of an assessment questionnaire, such as an SF-36, AAOS Hip & Knee Questionnaire)
	NUMERATOR NOTE: For the purposes of this measure, the method for assessing function and pain is left up to the discretion of the individual clinician and based on the needs of the patient. The assessment may be done via a validated instrument (though one is not required) that measures pain and various functional elements including a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs).
Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily:
	Osteoarthritis Symptoms and Functional Status Assessed



Performance Met: 
// Osteoarthritis symptoms and functional status assessed (may include the use of a standardized scale or the completion of an assessment questionnaire, such as the SF-36, AAOS Hip & Knee Questionnaire)
*	1006F		// Osteoarthritis symptoms and functional status assess



Performance Not Met: 
//  Osteoarthritis symptoms and functional status not assessed, reason not otherwise specified.   Append a reporting modifier (8P) to CPT II code 1006F 
*	1006F8P		// 	Reason not otherwise specified


Exclusions:
None.
