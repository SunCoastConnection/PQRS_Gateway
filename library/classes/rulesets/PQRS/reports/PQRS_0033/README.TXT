Measure #33 (NQF 0241): Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation: Anticoagulant Therapy Prescribed for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) at Discharge
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care


DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of
ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with documented
permanent, persistent, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were
prescribed an anticoagulant at discharge

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported for patients under active treatment for
ischemic stroke or TIA with documented atrial fibrillation at discharge
from a hospital during the reporting period. It is anticipated that
clinicians who care for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or
TIA in the hospital setting will submit this measure.
Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, and patient demographics
are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s
denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator
of the measure.  The quality-data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry-based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data.



DENOMINATOR:
All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke
or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with documented permanent, persistent,
or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Definitions:
First Detected – Only one diagnosed episode.
Persistent Atrial Fibrillation – Recurrent episodes that last more than 7 days.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation – Recurrent episodes that self terminate in less than 7 days.
Permanent Atrial Fibrillation – An ongoing long term episode.


Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases):
*	Patients aged >= 18 years on date of encounter
AND
*	Diagnosis for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack(TIA)(ICD9/10)

NUMERATOR:
Patients who were prescribed an anticoagulant at discharge
	Definitions:
	Anticoagulants – warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban*
	*The above list of medications/drug names is based on clinical guidelines and other evidence. The specified drugs were selected based on the strength of evidence for their clinical effectiveness. This list of selected drugs may not be all-inclusive or current. Physicians and other health care professionals should refer to the FDA’s web site page entitled “Drug Safety Communications” for up-to-date drug recall and alert information when prescribing medications.
	Prescribed – May include prescription given to the patient for anticoagulant therapy at discharge OR anticoagulant to be continued after discharge as documented in the discharge medication list.
	NUMERATOR NOTE: In order to meet the measure, anticoagulant therapy is to be prescribed at the time of discharge. If a physician other than the discharging physician (eg, consulting physician) is reporting on this measure, it should be clear from the documentation that the prescription is being ordered for the patient at the time of discharge, and included in the “medications prescribed at discharge”.
