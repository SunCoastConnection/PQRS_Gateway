National Quality Strategy Domain: Community/Population Health


DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 6 months and older seen for a visit between
October 1 and March 31 who received an influenza immunization OR who
reported previous receipt of an influenza immunization

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once for visits for patients seen between January and March for the 2014-2015 influenza season AND a minimum of once for visits for patients seen between October and December for the 2015-2016 influenza season. This measure is intended to determine whether or not all patients aged 6 months and older received (either from the reporting physician or from an alternate care provider) the influenza immunization during the flu season. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.
	*  If reporting this measure between January 1, 2015 and March 31, 2015, quality-data code G8482 should be reported when the influenza immunization is administered to the patient during the months of August, September, October, November, and December of 2014 or January, February, and March of 2015 for the flu season ending March 31, 2015.
	*  If reporting this measure between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015, quality-data code G8482 should be reported when the influenza immunization is administered to the patient during the months of August, September, October, November, and December of 2015 for the flu season ending March 31, 2016.
	*  Influenza immunizations administered during the month of August or September of a given flu season (either 2014-2015 flu season OR 2015-2016 flu season) can be reported when a visit occurs during the flu season (October 1 - March 31). In these cases, G8482 should be reported.
