Measure #32 (NQF 0325): Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation: Discharged on Antithrombotic Therapy
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care

DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of
ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who were prescribed
antithrombotic therapy at discharge

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported for patients under active treatment
for ischemic stroke or TIA at discharge from a hospital during the
reporting period. Part B claims data will be analyzed to determine the
hospital discharge. If multiple qualifying diagnoses are submitted on
the same claim form, only one instance of reporting will be counted. It
is anticipated that clinicians who care for patients with a diagnosis of
ischemic stroke or TIA in the hospital setting will submit this measure.

Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes and patient demographics
are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s
denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator
of the measure.  The quality-data codes listed do not need to be submitted
for registry-based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted
for those registries that utilize claims data.


DENOMINATOR:
All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

NUMERATOR:
	Patients who were prescribed antithrombotic therapy at discharge

Numerator Instructions: If the consulting physician orders or agrees with a prior antithrombotic therapy order (from current or previous episodes of care during the reporting period) and there is supporting documentation, report G8696.
Definitions:
	Antithrombotic Therapy – Aspirin, combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban.*
	*The above list of medications/drug names is based on clinical guidelines and other evidence. The specified drugs were selected based on the strength of evidence for their clinical effectiveness. This list of selected drugs may not be all-inclusive or current. Physicians and other health care professionals should refer to the FDA’s web site page entitled “Drug Safety Communications” for up-to-date drug recall and alert information when prescribing medications.
	Prescribed – May include prescription given to the patient for antithrombotic therapy at discharge or antithrombotic therapy to be continued after discharge as documented in the discharge medication list.

NUMERATOR NOTE: In order to meet the measure, antithrombotic therapy is to be prescribed at the time of discharge. If a physician other than the discharging physician (eg, consulting physician) is reporting on this measure, it should be clear from the documentation that the prescription is being ordered for the patient at the time of discharge, and included in the “medications prescribed at discharge”.



Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily:
//	Antithrombotic Therapy Prescribed

Performance Met:
//  Antithrombotic therapy prescribed at discharge
//  Antithrombotic therapy not prescribed for documented reasons (eg,
patient admitted for performance of elective carotid intervention, patient
had stroke during hospital stay, patient expired during inpatient stay,
other medical reason(s)); (eg, patient left against medical advice,
other patient reason(s))
*	G8696		// Antithrombotic therapy prescribed at discharge
*	G8697		// Antithrombotic Therapy not Prescribed for Documented 


Performance Not Met: 
//  Antithrombotic Therapy Prescription not Prescribed, Reason not Given
*	G8698		// Antithrombotic therapy was not prescribed at discharge, reason not given
