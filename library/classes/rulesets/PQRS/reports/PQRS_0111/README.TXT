(Discussed this Measure at length with Lana.  Either it was adminstered
(or they said they had it) or provider fails performance.  Period.
She remembers the writeup for the measure being longer, so I think it's
been edited since previous years and I suspect exceptions 1P/2P/3P were
accidently dropped.  But, we'll do this one as written.  --leebc)
