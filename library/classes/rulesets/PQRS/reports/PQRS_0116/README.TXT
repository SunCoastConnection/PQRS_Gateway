Measure #116 (NQF 0058): Avoidance of Antibiotic Treatment in Adults With Acute Bronchitis
National Quality Strategy Domain: Efficiency and Cost Reduction


DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of adults 18 through 64 years of age with a diagnosis of
acute bronchitis who were not prescribed or dispensed an antibiotic
prescription on or 3 days after the episode

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported at each occurrence of acute bronchitis during the reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.

Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT or HCPCS codes, and patient
demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the
measureâs denominator. The listed numerator options are used to
report the numerator of the measure.  The quality-data codes listed do
not need to be submitted for registry-based submissions; however, these
codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data.



DENOMINATOR:
All patients aged 18 through 64 years of age with an outpatient or emergency department (ED) visit with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis during the measurement period
Definition:
	To determine eligibility, look for any of the listed antibiotic drugs below in the 30 days prior to the visit with the acute bronchitis diagnosis. As long as there are no prescriptions for the listed antibiotics during this time period, the patient is eligible for denominator inclusion.

NUMERATOR:
Patients who were not prescribed or dispensed antibiotics on or within
3 days of the initial date of service

Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated
as the number of patient encounters where antibiotics were neither
prescribed nor dispensed on or within 3 days of the episode for acute
bronchitis over the total number of encounters in the denominator
(patients aged 18 through 64 years with an outpatient or ED visit for
acute bronchitis). A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of
patients with acute bronchitis (eg, the proportion for whom antibiotics
were not prescribed or dispensed on or three days after the encounter).
