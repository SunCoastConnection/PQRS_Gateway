PQRS_0022

Measure #22 (NQF 0271): Perioperative Care: Discontinuation of Prophylactic Parenteral Antibiotics (Non-Cardiac Procedures)
National Quality Strategy Domain: Patient Safety

2015 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: CLAIMS, REGISTRY

DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 18 years and older
undergoing procedures with the indications for prophylactic parenteral
antibiotics AND who received a prophylactic parenteral antibiotic, which
have an order for discontinuation of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics
within 24 hours of surgical end time

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed
during the reporting period for patients who undergo non-cardiac
surgical procedures with the indications for prophylactic parenteral
antibiotics. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. It is
anticipated that clinicians who perform the listed surgical procedures
as specified in the denominator coding will submit this measure.
Measure Reporting via Registry:
CPT codes and patient demographics are used to identify patients who
are included in the measure's denominator.  The listed numerator options
are used to report the numerator of the measure.

DENOMINATOR:
All non-cardiac surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing
procedures with the indications for prophylactic parenteral antibiotics
AND who received a prophylactic parenteral antibiotic
Denominator Instructions:
* CPT Category I procedure codes billed by surgeons performing surgery on
the same patient, submitted with modifier 62 (indicating two surgeons,
ie, dual procedures) will be included in the denominator population.
Both surgeons participating in the PQRS will be fully accountable for
the clinical action described in the measure.
*  For the purpose of this measure of antibiotic discontinuation,
patients may be counted as having "received a prophylactic parenteral
antibiotic" if the antibiotic was received within 4 hours prior to the
surgical incision (or start of procedure when no incision is required)
or intraoperatively.


Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases):
*	Patients aged >= 18 years on date of encounter
AND
*	Patient encounter during the reporting period: Listed below
are non-cardiac surgical procedures for which prophylactic parenteral
antibiotics are indicated.  SURGICAL PROCEDUREs:  Integumentary,

NUMERATOR:
// Non-cardiac surgical patients who have an order for discontinuation of
prophylactic parenteral antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time
	Numerator Instructions: There must be documentation of order
	(written order, verbal order, or standing order/protocol)
	specifying that prophylactic parenteral antibiotic is to be
	discontinued within 24 hours of surgical end time OR specifying a
	course of antibiotic administration limited to that 24 hour period
	(eg, "to be given every 8 hours for three doses" or for "one time"
	IV dose orders) OR documentation that prophylactic parenteral
	antibiotic was discontinued within 24 hours of surgical end time.
	Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily:
		Documentation of Order for Discontinuation of Prophylactic
		Parenteral Antibiotics (written order, verbal order,
		or standing order/protocol) Within 24 Hours of Surgical
		End Time (Two CPT II codes [4049F & 4046F] are required
		on the claim form to submit this numerator option)
	Note: CPT Category II code 4049F is provided for
		documentation that antibiotic discontinuation was
		ordered or that antibiotic discontinuation was
		accomplished. Report CPT Category II code 4049F if
		antibiotics were discontinued within 24 hours.

Performance Met:
(
	*	4049F		// Documentation that order was given to discontinue prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time, non-cardiac procedure
	AND
	*	4046F		// Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior to surgical incision or given intraoperatively
)

OR

// Prophylactic Parenteral Antibiotics not Discontinued for Medical Reasons (4049F-1P & 4046F] are required on the claim form to submit this numerator option)
//   4049F1P  --  Documentation of medical reason(s) for not discontinuing prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time (eg, patients enrolled in clinical trials, patients with documented infection prior to surgical procedure of interest, patients who had other procedures requiring general or spinal anesthesia that occurred within three days prior to the procedure of interest [during separate surgical episodes], patients who were receiving antibiotics more than 24 hours prior to surgery [except colon surgery patients taking oral prophylactic antibiotics], patients who were receiving antibiotics within 24 hours prior to arrival [except colon surgery patients taking oral prophylactic antibiotics], patients who received urinary antiseptics only, other medical reason(s))
//   4046F  --  Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior to surgical incision or given intraoperatively

Performance Not Met:
//  Prophylactic Parenteral Antibiotics not Discontinued, Reason not Otherwise Specified (Two CPT II codes [4049F-8P & 4046F] are required on the claim form to submit this numerator option) Append a reporting modifier (8P) to 4049F to report circumstances when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not otherwise specified.

*	4049F:8P		//  Order was not given to discontinue prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time, non-cardiac procedure, reason not otherwise specified
AND
	4046F			//  Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior to surgical incision or given intraoperatively



Performance Exclusion:
