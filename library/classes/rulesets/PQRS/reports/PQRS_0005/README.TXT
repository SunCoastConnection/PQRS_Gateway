Measure #5 (NQF 0081): Heart Failure (HF): Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) Therapy for Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD)

National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care
2015 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY

DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% who were prescribed ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting OR at each hospital discharge


INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported for all heart failure patients a minimum of once per reporting period when seen in the outpatient setting AND reported at each hospital discharge (99238* and 99239*) during the reporting period.
*NOTE: When reporting CPT code 99238 and 99239, it is recommended the measure be reported each time the code is submitted for hospital discharge.
