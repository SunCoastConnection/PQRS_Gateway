INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period
for patients seen during the reporting period. Female patients aged 65
years and older should have a central DXA measurement ordered or performed
at least once since the time they turned 60 years or have pharmacologic
therapy prescribed to prevent or treat osteoporosis. There is no diagnosis
