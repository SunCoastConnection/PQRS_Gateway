Measure #7 (NQF 0070): Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Beta-Blocker Therapy  -- Prior Myocardial Infarction (MI) or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) 
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care

2015 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY

DESCRIPTION:
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have a prior MI OR a current or prior LVEF < 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy

INSTRUCTIONS:
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all patients with a diagnosis of CAD seen during the reporting period. Only patients who had at least two denominator eligible visits during the reporting period will be counted for Reporting Criteria 1 and Reporting Criteria 2 of this measure. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure for the primary management of patients with CAD based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.

This measure will be calculated with 2 performance rates:
      1) Percentage of patients with a diagnosis of CAD or history of cardiac surgery who have a current or prior LVEF < 40% prescribed a beta-blocker
      2) Percentage of patients with a diagnosis of CAD or history of cardiac surgery who have prior myocardial infarction prescribed a beta-blocker

Measure Reporting via Registry:
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, a G-code, and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure.

The eligible professional should submit data on one of the reporting criteria, depending on the clinical findings. 
*	If the patient has CAD or history of cardiac surgery and a current or prior LVEF < 40%, use Denominator Reporting Criteria
1. 
*	 If the patient has CAD or history of cardiac surgery and have prior (resolved) MI, use Denominator Reporting Criteria 2. 
*	If the patient has both prior MI and LVEF < 40%, the eligible professional may report quality data codes for Reporting Criteria 1 and this will count as appropriate reporting for this patient.


There are two reporting criteria for this measure:
      1) Patients who are 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CAD or history of cardiac surgery who have a current or prior LVEF < 40%
 OR
      2) Patients who are 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CAD or history of cardiac surgery who have prior myocardial infarction

REPORTING CRITERIA 1:
All patients with a diagnosis of CAD or history of cardiac surgery who have a current or prior LVEF < 40 %

DENOMINATOR (REPORTING CRITERIA 1):
// All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have a current or prior LVEF < 40%
//  DENOMINATOR NOTE: In order for the patient to be considered for the measure, the diagnosis of CAD must be an active diagnosis and patient could have been diagnosed prior to the denominator eligible visits within the measurement year.
//  OR
//  The cardiac surgery could have been performed prior to the denominator eligible visits within the measurement year.
//  In order for the patient to be included in the either of the measure denominators, the patient must have two denominator eligible visits.
