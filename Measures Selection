Bridget and ME Computers want to "go live" with Preminger and Viera tomorrow. I have a call with them today at 2 to review databases for Preminger and for Viera Diagnostics. I am trying to preparea MIPS report for each account now. When I go to "Create MIPS Report", a report becomes avilable for Preminger, but with 0 as a denomibnator for all patients.Viera's report will not generate.
